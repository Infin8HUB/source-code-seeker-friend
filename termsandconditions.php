fraudulent, abusive, unlawful or improper activity, including, without limitation, money laundering
activities or engaging in a transaction out of market rates, or conduct otherwise in violation of this

such activity.</p>
<p>7.2. Money Laundering Prevention: Preventing money laundering is a top priority and goal for
regulatory authorities worldwide. Money laundering enables movement of illicit funds from criminal
activities and makes them potentially available for terrorist activity. At obfx we are fully committed

<p>1. Client identification and verification procedures via third-party data providers.</p>
<p>2. Identification, monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions</p>
<p>3. Maintenance of trading records over an extended period of time</p>
<p>4. Training of employees in regards to recognizing and preventing illicit financial</p>
<p>transactions.</p>
<p>5. OBFX reserves the right to collect and ask for additional forms of identification from our
clients prior to funding an account. Further the company reserves the right to refuse to
process a transfer at any point if it believes the funds are in any way related to money
laundering or criminal activity.</p>

clause.</p>

where your user name and password have been entered correctly, will be regarded as valid,
whether or not authorized by you.</p>
<p>8.3. Monies held in your account shall not attract any interest.</p>
<p>8.4. Accounts in which there have been no transactions (trading / withdrawals / deposits), for a set
period of 12 months, will be considered by the Company as being dormant accounts. Such dormant
accounts will be charged an annual maintenance fee of US$25 or the full amount of the free balance

zero. Consequently, all accounts with a zero free balance will be closed.</p>

<p>16. Risk Statement</p>

bear the loss of all the money they invest, and who understand the risks and have experience in
taking risks involved in trading in crypto currencies..</p>
<p>16.2. The maximum loss that may be incurred by any customer is the amount of money paid by
them to the Company including rolling fees for day trade deals.</p>
<p>16.3. Subject to market conditions, &lsquo;Stop Loss Orders&rsquo; shall be executed either at the exact
exchange rate selected by the customer, where the amount will be calculated automatically, or at
the exact amount of loss selected by the customer, where the exchange rate will be calculated
accordingly. A transaction of that nature shall be executed as soon as the distinctive (&ldquo;indicative&rdquo;)
exchange rate is found on the financial information systems which, including the Company&rsquo;s spread,
is either identical to the order given by the customer, or indicates an identical amount of loss
declared by the customer.</p>
<p>16.4. The calculation of the payout to be received for the options on the Site, at the time the option
is traded, will be based on the Company&rsquo;s best estimate of market prices and the expected level of
interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the option, and is
based on a complex arithmetic calculation. The calculation will include a spread in favor of the
Company.</p>
<p>16.5. The payout amounts offered to customers speculating on market or index prices, may differ
substantially from prices available in the primary markets where such options are traded, due to the
spread favoring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above. The Company does
not provide a market amongst or between customers for investments or speculations. Each option
traded by a customer via the Site is an individual Agreement made between that customer and the
Company, and is not transferable, negotiable or assignable to or with any third party.</p>

The Company&rsquo;s website OBFX.net is owned and operated by OBFX K.f.t whose
address is Cyprus Limassol 2, limasso, Cyprus, 1035.
The objective of Anti-Money laundering procedures that OBFX implements is to ensure that
customers engaging in certain activities are identified to a reasonable standard while minimizing the
compliance burden and impact on legitimate customers.</p>
<p>MONEY LAUNDERING</p>
<p>is the act of converting money or other monetary instruments gained from illegal activities into
money or investments that appear to be legitimate, so that its illegal source cannot be traced.
Domestic and international laws that apply to companies, whose customers can deposit and
withdraw funds from their accounts, make it illegal for OBFX, or its employees or agents, to
knowingly engage, or attempt to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property.</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The objective of Anti-Money laundering procedures that OBFX implements is to ensure that
customers engaging in certain activities are identified to a reasonable standard while minimizing the
compliance burden and impact on legitimate customers. OBFX is committed to assisting
governments to combat the threat of money laundering and financing terrorist activities around the
world. For that purpose, OBFX has set up a highly sophisticated electronic system. This system
documents and verifies client identification records, and tracks and maintains detailed records of all
transactions.</p>
<p>OBFX carefully tracks suspicious and significant transaction activities, and reports such activities
&ldquo;providing timely and comprehensive information&rdquo; to law enforcement bodies. To uphold the
integrity of reporting systems and to safeguard businesses, the legislative framework provides legal
protections to providers of such information.
In order to minimize the risk of money laundering and financing terrorist activities, OBFX neither
accepts cash deposits nor disburses cash under any circumstances.
OBFX reserves the right to refuse to process a transfer at any stage, where it believes the transfer
to be connected in any way to money laundering or criminal activity.
For the avoidance of any doubt, OBFX may detain or postpone payments for a set period of time at
its own discretion.
It is forbidden for OBFX to inform customers that they have been reported for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>AML</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES</p>
<p>For the purpose of complying with Anti-Money laundering laws, www.OBFX.net requires two
different documents to verify the identity of the customer.
The first document we require is a legal government-issued, identifying the document with the
picture of the customer on it. It may be a government-issued passport, driver&rsquo;s license (for countries
where the driver&rsquo;s license is a primary identification document) or local ID card (no company access
cards).</p>
<p>The second document we require is a bill with the customer&rsquo;s own name and actual address on it
issued 3 months ago at the earliest. It may be a utility bill, bank statement, an affidavit, or any other
document with the customer&rsquo;s name and address from an internationally recognized organization.
OBFX also requires a completed and physically-signed account application form to be submitted to
the company.</p>
<p>Customers are required to submit up to date identification and contact information in a timely
manner, as soon as changes occur.
Documents in non-western letters must be translated into English by an official translator; the
translation must be stamped and signed by the translator and sent together with the original
document with a clear picture of the customer on it.</p>
<p>DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS</p>
<p>OBFX requires all deposits, where the name of the originating customer is present, to come from
the name matching the name of the customer in our records. Third party payments are not
accepted.</p>
<p>As for withdrawals, money may be withdrawn from the same account and by the same way, it was
received. For withdrawals where the name of the recipient is present, the name must exactly match
the name of the customer in our records. If the deposit was made by wire transfer, funds may be
withdrawn only by wire transfer to the same bank and to the same account from which it originated.
If the deposit was made by means of electronic currency transfer, funds may be withdrawn only by
the means of electronic currency transfer through the same system and to the same account from
which it originated.</p>
